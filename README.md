# Music-Library-Management-System

The Project ‘Music Library Management System’ is a computerized system used to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related to the management of databases with musical information. The aim of the project is to expose the relevance and importance of Music Library Management Systems. 

The system allows the user, (namely an individual who is an employee of a Record Label or music management company) to arrange and organise songs, mainly in albums and to have access to artist details.

The system is designed such that all information on tracks and track details are readily available to all employees of said Record Label which allows them to access the information easily.

There are options to enter new songs into the database, manipulate already existing information and pull up information on various pre-existing albums and databases as and when it is required to do so.

The main purpose of this software is to reduce the manual errors involved in the music management process and make it convenient for the users to access relevant information and add new information when necessary.
